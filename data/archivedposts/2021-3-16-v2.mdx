## Welcome to my personal site v2!
Just a month after coding the v1 of my personal site, I've decided to completely redesign my personal site because
I wanted to go with a more minimalistic design.

I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) to make this website and it only took me
2 days!! Since learning React and Next a few months ago, I've been getting better at web dev and I'm looking forward
to discovering and learning more web dev tools in the future.

Anyways, I'm running out of things to talk about and I've only written 3 sentences LMAO. Writing's not my forte,
but I might include devlogs, tutorials, and project ideas/reviews in my blog in the future.

Have a nice day! ðŸ™ƒ
